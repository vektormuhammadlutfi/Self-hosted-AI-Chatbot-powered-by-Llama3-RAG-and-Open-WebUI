## üìã Code Style Guidelines

### Python Code

- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to functions and classes
- Include type hints where appropriate
- Keep functions focused and under 50 lines when possible

Example:
```python
def process_document(file_path: str, chunk_size: int = 512) -> List[Document]:
    """
    Process a document and split it into chunks.
    
    Args:
        file_path: Path to the document file
        chunk_size: Size of each chunk in tokens
        
    Returns:
        List of Document objects
    """
    # Implementation
    pass
```

### Comments

- Write self-documenting code when possible
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep comments up to date with code changes

### Error Handling

Always include proper error handling:

```python
try:
    result = process_data(data)
except ValueError as e:
    logger.error(f"Invalid data format: {e}")
    raise
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
    raise
```
